## 🛠️ Backend Requirements

Make sure your backend has:
- ✅ Gemini API key configured in `.env`
- ✅ Database seeded with questions
- ✅ Server running on port 3000

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend won't connect to backend:
- Check backend is running on http://localhost:3000
- Check frontend `.env` has correct `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### Quiz questions not loading:
- Check backend /api/quiz/class10 endpoint works
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify authentication token is being sent

### Gemini AI not working:
- Check backend has valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Check backend console for Gemini API errors
- Should fallback to default responses if AI fails

### Authentication issues:
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Check backend JWT_USER_PASSWORD is set
- Verify /api/users/register and /api/users/login work
